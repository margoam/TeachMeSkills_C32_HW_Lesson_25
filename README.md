### Tasks:
- Implement a LoginServlet that will handle HTTP requests for user login (with username and password passed as path parameters). If the user is found in the system, store their role (e.g., "USER" or "ADMIN") and username in the session scope.
- Implement a HomeServlet that will display a message indicating who is logged in and their role. If no user is logged in, respond with an "Access Denied" message (either as plain text or with a 401 status code).
- Configure a Listener to log all users who have logged into the system.
